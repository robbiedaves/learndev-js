# learndev-js-vanilla

This is a simple project to mess around with vanilla javascript

The project uses a number of npm packages
* eslint
* babel
* webpack
etc

to start the server type:
```
npm start -s
```

This will do the following:
* Bundle the files with Webpack
* Check if any of the npm packages has any know vulnerabilities
* check the code with ESLint
* start the server
* launch a browser and open the webpage (localhost:3000)
